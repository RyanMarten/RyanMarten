Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a [Computer Science Master's](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ms-program) student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Most recently I was an Applied Machine Learning Intern at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) where I evaluated federated learning frameworks. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), supervised by Professor [Sven Dickinson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven/). I was a Research Intern at [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) and Research Intern at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with [Fredo Durand](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/). My current reserach focus is in language vision integration and general purpose learning, supervised by [Derek Hoiem](https://dhoiem.cs.illinois.edu/). <!--My long term research goal is to use machine learning to create models that reason meaningfully about concepts both in language and vision. -->
