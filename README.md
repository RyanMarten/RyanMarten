Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergrad in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Sven Dickinson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven/). Most recently I was a Research Intern at [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I'm interested in language vision integration, generative models, and multi-modal representations. My long term research goal is to use machine learning to create models that reason meaningfully about concepts both in language and vision.
